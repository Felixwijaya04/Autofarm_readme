## ðŸ”¥Development Process
- **Drag and Drop** <br> Our main game mechanic is drag and drop a code block. Player drags the code block from the code list then drop it in the corresponding code slot. To make a drag and drop features, we use grid layout group to create a slots for each type of code. Then we do the same thing to the code slot but vertically.

<br>When player hold and drag one of the code logo, the game will instantiate a corresponding code block. The code block can only be placed inside the code slot area otherwise the code block will be deleted. Player can delete a code block that has been placed inside the slot by drag and drop it outside the area.
